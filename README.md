# Youtube_Translated_Music_Video_Creator

This computer program is a multi-threaded Python application that performs several tasks in a streamlined manner. It downloads a YouTube video and its transcription from the platform, and then proceeds to translate the transcript into the language of the user's choice. Finally, the translated transcription is added to the video as a subtitle, providing a more accessible and inclusive experience for viewers with different language preferences. This program effectively combines various processes into a single, convenient solution, making it easier for users to access and understand the content they are interested in.
